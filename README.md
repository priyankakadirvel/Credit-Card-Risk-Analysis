# Credit-Card-Risk-Analysis

This project aims to predict customer loan defaults using a Logistic Regression model. By analyzing a dataset of financial and demographic information, I developed a machine learning model to identify key factors that contribute to a customer defaulting on their loan. The insights from this project can help financial institutions make more informed lending decisions, ultimately reducing their risk.
